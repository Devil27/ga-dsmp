### Project Overview

 Project provides overview on the factors as Age, Race, Senior population and their average weekly income and importance of education on the average pay scale


### Learnings from the project

 Learned it through thr Data dase on GreyAtom


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 used numpy for faster computation and used multiple built-in functions for the process optimisation
used fnctions on single coulmns after separating them on required parameters
checked for average and mean values
checked for variance on basic level by using std deviation function
